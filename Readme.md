### Commit your changes

When you made some significant changes, and at the end of every day you worked on the website, open the Github Desktop app, under `uncommitted changes`, select all files and add a comment to explain what you changed, then hit `Commit to master`.

Then hit the `Publish` button in the top right corner to sync your changes to GitHub.
