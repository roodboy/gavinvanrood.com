            <p>
              After conducting extensive research into each building’s heritage,
              architecture, and local area history, I created a unique emblem
              for each property, and proposed concepts for external and internal
              signage. Threading this content into bespoke typographic and
              illustrative wall murals, I curated the lobby spaces to enrich the
              guest experience and lift the interiors.
            </p>

            <p>
              A series of wall plaques, external signage and wayfinding signage
              was successfully rolled out across the property portfolio,
              inceasing brand awareness and cementing Native as part of the
              fabric of the community.
            </p>

            <p>
              Project management included site visits, conceptual designs,
              planning applications, supplier liaison, artwork production and
              installation supervision.

              As lead creative and brand guardian, as part of a dedicated
